# Code Refactor Starter Code
The purpose of this challenge was to increase searchability of the website, consolidate CSS selectors and properties and improve accesibility by naming elements in .html and .css instead of non-descriptive code. This excercise improved coder understanding of .css and .html elements, as well as how real-world tickets operate.

Approaches I took included renaming elements semantically in .hmtl and related .css elements, then checking format on website did not change. I also renamed the title and ordered elements in proper priority.
